## ABOUT

In my last role I discovered a passion for analysis and data science. Since leaving Nasdaq, my family and I took advantage of an opportunity to live in India for a few years. Although I wasn't working, I spent my time honing the skills (including Python, R, SQL, and statistics) necessary for a career that may leverage both my work experience with my passion for data science.
