Just a test for now.

I hold an MBA from the [Yale School of Management](https://som.yale.edu) and a BA from [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu). I have worked in Hong Kong and Australia and, recently, resided in India with my wife and two children. I spend much of my time learning how to use R and Python to explore, clean, and visualize large datasets. I also enjoying making gadgets using Arduino and similar products. And when I'm not at my desk or workbench, I enjoy cycling for fun and fitness.
