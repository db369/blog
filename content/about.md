I was a Specialist at [Nasdaq](http://www.nasdaq.com) in Corporate Solutions (formerly part of Thomson Reuters) through November 2014. When I joined Thomson in 2004, I focused on valuation and quantitative analytics, however, I became particularly skilled at solving unique problems for clients using statistics and drawing insights from large sets of data. I have helped clients analyze counter-party risk, value themselves against peers, optimize capital structure, and evaluate market volatility. I have also worked with internal strategy in analyzing the business, its clients, and service structure as well as with business development teams to assess prospective services and interdepartmental product offerings. 

Prior to joining Thomson Reuters, I was a corporate development professional and held roles at [Xerox](https://www.xerox.com), [PanAmSat](http://www.intelsat.com/announcement/2006-intelsat-acquires-panamsat/), and [Amphenol](https://www.amphenol.com). In these roles, I evaluated, analyzed, coordinated, and executed strategic M&A and divestitures. I also spent some time at [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/) as an Associate in Project Finance where I helped structure transactions for U.S. and Latin American telecommunications companies. Just after college, I worked at [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom](https://www.skadden.com) where I not only provided analytical support in significant M&A transactions and antitrust litigation cases, but also drafted offering memoranda for private placements and IPO's.

I hold an MBA from the [Yale School of Management](https://som.yale.edu) and a BA from [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu). I have worked in Hong Kong and Australia and, recently, resided in India with my wife and two children. I spend much of my time learning how to use R and Python to explore, clean, and visualize large datasets. I also enjoying making gadgets using Arduino and similar products. And when I'm not at my desk or workbench, I enjoy cycling for fun and fitness.
